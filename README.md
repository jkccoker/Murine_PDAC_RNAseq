# Murine_PDAC_RNAseq
Quality control, alignment, and quantification of murine PDAC RNA-seq data

RNAseq_PDACtumor_Github.docx contains bash code for RNA-seq analysis.

Each .genes.results file is the quantified RNA-seq alignment output for one sample. Sample metadata is in metadata_samples.csv

DESeq2_PDACtumor_Github.r contains the R code for DESeq2 differential expression analysis of the .genes.results files

DESeq2_PDACtumor_Github.ipynb contains the same R code as DESeq2_PDACtumor_Github.r, but in Jupyter notebook format
