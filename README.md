## Murine_PDAC_RNAseq
Quality control, alignment, quantification, and differential expression analysis of murine PDAC RNA-seq data

RNAseq_PDACtumor_Github.docx contains the bash scripts for RNA-seq analysis.

RSEM_quant_results_part1.zip and RSEM_quant_results_part2.zip contain the quantified RNA-seq alignment output for the samples (the .genes.results files from RSEM). Sample metadata is in metadata_samples.csv

DESeq2_PDACtumor_Github.r contains the R code for DESeq2 differential expression analysis of the .genes.results files

DESeq2_PDACtumor_Github.ipynb contains the same R code as DESeq2_PDACtumor_Github.r, but in Jupyter notebook format
